# Petra's World — Asset Generation Progress

This file is the single progress tracker for the emoticon replacement project. Update it as source inventory, user approvals, generation, and QA proceed.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Source audit and inventory.** A literal pictograph scan has now been run across the first-party runtime JS/MJS/HTML/CSS/JSON files in `game/` (excluding the third-party minified Three.js bundle). The inventory has been expanded and duplicate asset IDs consolidated. It remains a review draft: every candidate's visual role and render scale still need final semantic verification and user approval. One generated object candidate (`object-bone`) has been user-approved as an illustration candidate and recorded below; it is not yet designated production-ready.

## Fixed decisions

- [x] Use the exact user-supplied brown bear as the main style reference.
- [x] Use the exact user-supplied plain golden star as the matching secondary reference.
- [x] Keep Explorer character sprites and animation frames unchanged; only consider other emoticons in that game.
- [x] Keep Kitty character sprites and animation frames unchanged; only consider other emoticons in that game.
- [x] In 3D Racing, replace only emoji glyphs; preserve 3D models, geometry, environment, and rendering.
- [x] Preserve suitable existing illustrations; do not regenerate assets just to make them new.
- [x] Keep standard interface controls as SVG/CSS icons or text where appropriate.
- [x] Store project documentation and prompts in `resources/`; approved runtime assets only in `game/`.
- [x] Run literal emoji/pictograph scan across first-party runtime JS/MJS/HTML/CSS/JSON files under `game/` (excluding third-party minified Three.js).
- [x] Add initial source-confirmed candidates from animals, animal counting, candy, sorting, spatial, classroom, sequencing, rhythm, piano, maze, animal puzzle, adventure-mode fish, shared celebration, and 3D Racing page UI.
- [x] Enumerate the emoji-backed Serbian phonics data and identify dynamic compare/adventure/world-theme pools; final semantic/render-path verification remains.
- [x] Scan canonical `game/` pages, game modules, shared modules, CSS, manifests, and runtime configs for literal pictographs; comments/docs and generated values require judgment.
- [ ] User approves final asset inventory.
- [ ] Generate and review first small test batch.
- [ ] User approves the test batch against the fixed references.
- [ ] Generate remaining approved assets in manageable batches.
- [ ] Run image transparency, dimensions, file-size, naming, and visual consistency checks.
- [ ] Prepare final implementation handoff for implementation AI.
- [ ] Implementation AI swaps only the approved emoji render sites and runs regression checks.

## Source-confirmed starting findings

### 3D Racing — `game/pages/racing3d.html`

- [x] 🏎️ page title decoration — review whether to keep as a small illustration or remove.
- [x] 🌸 flower counter — review for a small matching flower asset.
- [x] 🌍 world selector icon — prefer a consistent UI icon or small simple illustration; reuse it wherever repeated.
- [x] 🔊 / 🔇 music state — UI icon task, not watercolor illustration.
- [x] 🏁 win/start finish decoration — review for a small matching flag asset or remove decoration.
- [x] ➡️ next-world arrow — UI icon task, not watercolor illustration.
- [x] 🔄 restart arrow — UI icon task, not watercolor illustration.
- [x] 🏎️ favicon — app-icon task, not part of the object asset batch.
- [x] Audit `game/games/racing3d.mjs` render/UI path. Confirmed emoji UI glyphs (e.g. sound state/finish fallback); 3D pickups/obstacles are mesh geometry and remain out of scope.

## Batch log

| Batch | Scope | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 | Source audit and inventory | IN PROGRESS | Inventory v0.4 has expanded source coverage and deduplicated repeated asset IDs. Literal scan completed; semantic candidate approval is still pending. |
| B1 | 1–3 test objects selected from approved inventory | NOT STARTED | Wait for user approval of final inventory. |
| B2+ | Small generation batches | NOT STARTED | Avoid wasting free-tier image generations; do not regenerate approved assets. |
| QA | Transparency, dimensions, consistency, runtime/offline checks | NOT STARTED | Use approved assets only. |
| Handoff | Asset map and implementation instructions | NOT STARTED | Final handoff must list exact source render sites and filenames. |

## Asset status ledger

Add one row per asset. Keep this table synchronized with the inventory.

| Asset ID | Replaces glyph / current visual | Used by | Prompt/reference saved? | File | Status | QA / notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `object-bone` | 🦴 | `game/games/spatial.js` — “Where is the bone?” task | Prompt was generated in chat; no separate prompt file verified | `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/bone.png` | GENERATED / USER-APPROVED CANDIDATE | User praised the result and reported adding it to the repo; production readiness, transparency, dimensions, file size, and in-game scale not independently checked |

## Decisions / issues

- The broad preliminary inventory document was intentionally superseded by the narrower emoticon-only scope. Do not generate all of its speculative candidates.
- The exact original reference image files should be stored in `references/` before production generation if they are not already available as project files.
- Source inventory must distinguish emoji pictographs from SVG controls, CSS geometry, ordinary text, and actual 3D models.


## Latest source-audit update — 2026-10-11

- [x] Scanned the canonical first-party runtime source/data/page/style/manifest files for literal emoji/pictograph characters.
- [x] Expanded inventory with additional concepts from Serbian phonics, comparison/spatial activities, day/night classroom scenes, seasonal racing scenery, and page-level UI.
- [x] Consolidated duplicate asset IDs and merged their known use sites (including cow glyph variants and repeated shell rows); inventory table IDs are now unique.
- [ ] Manually verify every proposed illustration against actual render scale, semantic teaching purpose, existing PNG assets, and excluded character/3D areas.
- [ ] User approves the final treatment of each row before any generation begins.


## Asset update — 2026-10-16

- [x] Recorded `object-bone` as generated at `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/bone.png` after verifying the path exists on `main`.
- [x] User praised the bone result and reported adding it to the repository; this is recorded as approval of the illustration candidate, not as proof of production QA.
- [ ] Verify image dimensions, file size, alpha/transparency, and visual legibility at the actual spatial-game render size.
- [ ] After QA, decide whether to promote the asset to a production-ready location and update its inventory location accordingly.


## Asset update — 2026-10-18

- [x] Verified commit `bd526899f54940e627a4c5f7c3402e4c9a55b048` adds `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/elephant.png` to `main`.
- [x] Recorded `animal-elephant` in the asset inventory as a **generated, user-approved candidate**.
- [ ] Independently inspect the committed PNG at full size and verify dimensions, file size, alpha/transparency, edge quality, and legibility at the actual animal-flashcard render size.
- [ ] Compare the committed file directly with the canonical bear/star reference images before declaring style QA complete.
- [ ] Decide whether to promote it to a production-ready location after QA; it is not integrated into runtime and is not marked production-ready.
- Note: the user approved the illustration in conversation. That approval does not by itself establish technical QA or runtime integration.


## Animal asset update — 2026-10-18

- [x] Verified on `main` that `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/lion.png` exists (GitHub returned blob SHA `c493a9e7bc3c78d1b177889f6a874dc34a64b895`).
- [x] Verified on `main` that `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/frog.png` exists (GitHub returned blob SHA `3a46c83840b1e0babbcda6eb71de65b621202411`).
- [x] Updated the asset inventory rows for lion and frog to record their WIP paths.
- [ ] Inspect both committed PNG files at full size and verify dimensions, file size, alpha/transparency, edge quality, and legibility at the actual animal-flashcard render size.
- [ ] Compare both images directly with the canonical bear/star references and existing animal candidates.
- [ ] Decide whether either candidate is ready for promotion; neither is marked production-ready or integrated into runtime.
- Note: GitHub's file fetch returned empty Base64 content for lion and frog despite returning blob SHAs. Existence is verified; image bytes and technical properties were not verified by that fetch.

## Animal asset update — 2026-10-19

- [x] Verified that `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/pig.png` exists on `main`; GitHub blob SHA: `ef3e52435f005acd57f06d4ff9eabed4690e3b50`.
- [x] Updated the `animal-pig` inventory row with the confirmed WIP path and status **GENERATED / CANDIDATE — TECHNICAL QA PENDING**.
- [x] Inspected the actual repository image. PNG IHDR reports 1448 × 1086 pixels, 8-bit RGBA (color type 6). The illustration is readable and broadly matches the soft, warm storybook direction.
- [ ] Verify actual alpha values/background transparency, file size, edge quality, and visible colored fringes around the silhouette; RGBA support alone does not prove transparent background pixels.
- [ ] Compare pig directly against the canonical bear/star references and related animal candidates at full size and representative game sizes.
- [ ] Confirm whether the same pig image reads correctly in both counting and candy-game contexts; no runtime integration or game tests were performed as part of this update.
- Status remains a WIP candidate: not marked user-approved, production-ready, or runtime-integrated by this documentation update.

## Animal asset update — 2026-10-19 (horse)

- [x] Verified that `resources/General_reviews/Asset_Generation/assets_work_in_progress_bundle/horse.png` exists on `main`; GitHub blob SHA: `a00b4f51b379880f7a8d38dc0796e0e2567ade00`.
- [x] Updated the `animal-horse` inventory row with its verified WIP path and status **GENERATED / CANDIDATE — TECHNICAL QA PENDING**.
- [x] Reviewed the generated horse illustration shown in this conversation for subject readability and broad storybook-style fit.
- [ ] Inspect the exact committed PNG bytes at full size and verify dimensions, file size, actual alpha/transparency, edge quality, and any colored fringes. The current GitHub file fetch returned an empty Base64 payload despite confirming the blob/path, so those technical properties remain unverified.
- [ ] Compare the committed horse file directly against the canonical bear/star anchors and other animal candidates at full size and representative in-game sizes.
- [ ] Confirm the horse image's intended rendering contexts (animal memory, candy game, Serbian phonics) and whether its background/crop is suitable in each. No runtime integration or game tests were performed for this update.
- Status remains a WIP candidate; it is not marked production-ready or runtime-integrated.

## Next-asset analysis — chicken vs. existing duck candidate

- **Recommended next action: audit the existing duck candidate before generating another animal.** The inventory already points to `assets_work_in_progress_bundle/duck.png`, so mandatory preflight requires checking whether it can be accepted, refined, or rejected before spending another generation attempt.
- If the duck is not suitable, **chicken** is the next sensible new-animal candidate: current source uses it in counting and candy contexts, and the inventory also has a separate rooster use in the farm puzzle/scenery. Before generating, reconcile whether a single chicken illustration can clearly serve both chicken and rooster contexts or whether those should remain distinct.
- Avoid generating a duplicate chicken until the existing duck file has been inspected and the chicken/rooster semantic decision is recorded. Keep the fixed bear/star references as style anchors; do not treat the horse as a new approved style exemplar until the user explicitly approves the specific image.
